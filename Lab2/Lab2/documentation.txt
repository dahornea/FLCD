For the Symbol Table I implemented 1 Hash Table for identifiers, int constants and string constants.
The hash table is generic. The generic type represents the data type of the object that's inserted in the table.
The GetByKey method returns the value associated with a key.
The AddSymbol method adds a symbol to the table.
The GetPair method returns a key-value pair based on the given key.
The getSize method returns the size of the hash table.
